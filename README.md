 - For my portfolio, I am using the parallax effect JS library and a nav bar for ease of navigation. I am also using some bootsrap elements along with custom CSS
 - Currently, my contact form does not go anywhere, but I plan to add that functionality soon 
 - Right now, I only have links to my bootcamp projects, but I plan to add some business case studies to showcase my Salesforce expertise
